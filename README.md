## Welcome to my page!
Hi! Thank you for checking out my page. My name is Quoc Huynh and I am a 3rd year student at UC Berkeley studying Data Science with an emphasis in Economics.
I am from East Side San Jose, California and am a first generation student. Below are some of my highlighted projects that you can check out! Some of my personal interests include [Marvel's Daredevil](https://www.marvel.com/characters/daredevil-matthew-murdock), [The Arctic Monkeys](https://www.arcticmonkeys.com/), [Soccer](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/), and [NFTs](https://www.veve.me/)! 

<p>I would also like to use this space to give thanks and show my appreciation to these people who have helped me through my journey through college and in life.</p>
