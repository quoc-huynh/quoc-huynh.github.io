## Bureau of Transportation Statistics Group Project

This project was for our Data 102 (Data, Inference, and Decisions) class at University of California, Berkeley that is an advanced upper-divsion course taught to both undergraduates and graduate students. This group project was based on the Bureau of Transportation Statistics dataset that is open to the public and attempts to answers the question of 1) How did COVID affect transportation in urban versus rural counties in California differently?
and 2) What is the effect of government spending, specifically, infrastructure spending on road safety?

In this repo, our final report showcases and explains the findings that we found while working on this project as well as the code that was used to aid in our analysis and reasoning. We utilized multiple statistical methods in order to come to our conclusions which include multiple hyptothesis questions utilzing P-value correction methods such as the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure, econometric OLS regressions, time-series corrections, and much more. To summarize our findings, we concluded that there were indeed different effects happening to multiple counties in CA and that government spending did indeed affect highway fatalities. You can find our analysis and evidence for these conclusions as well as a more in depth explanation in our final report. Thank you!
