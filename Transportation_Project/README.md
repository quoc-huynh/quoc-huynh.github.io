## Bureau of Transportation Statistics Group Project

This group project was based on the Bureau of Transportation Statistics dataset that is open to the public. This project attemps to answers the question of 1) How did COVID affect transportation in urban versus rural counties in California differently?
and 2) What is the effect of government spending, specifically, infrastructure spending on road safety?

In this repo, our final report showcases and explains the findings that we found while working on this project as well as the code that was used to aid in our analysis and reasoning.
